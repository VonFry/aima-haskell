# IMPORTANT

This project is only for myself to exercise with `Haskell`.

The code is written with a book named `AIMA`. [See more](#book-github)

# AIMA

Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach

Haskell implementation of algorithms from Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach"

## Intro

It is a library for `AIMA`. So I think it can be used in any project.

## Install

I suggest that installing it into a sandbox environment.

You can install it with cabal or stack.

***Now, the project is not on hackage, so you must download it and build it by yourself. Haddock must be built if you want to use it.***

## Usage

Details: see ***haddock***.

The project contains data struct and algorithms. All data struct in `Aima.Data`. And algorithms are classified by function.

For example:

Searching algorithms is in `Aima.Search`. It contains `A*`, `bfs` and so on.

## Example

See `tests` dir.

# Book Github

[aimacode](https://github.com/aimacode)

It has a lot of code for aima to learn.
